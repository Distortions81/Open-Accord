# Open Accord Agent Notes

## Prototype Policy (Pre-Beta)

- Do not add legacy/backward-compatibility support during prototype phase.
- Prefer clean breaks over compatibility shims when changing protocol, APIs, or message types.
- Remove old paths when replacing behavior unless explicitly requested otherwise.
- Revisit compatibility strategy at beta milestone.
